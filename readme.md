# Finn Digital's Rails Templates

Over the last two years we have developed a consistent pattern for developing rails applications and these templates help speed up the process of getting a new app ready to start development

## Usage

`rails new [appname] -T -m http://github.com/finndigital/rails-template/[template].rb`

Currently we just have `basic.rb` in the templates folder, but this will no doubt chance as we begin new projects (e.g. a new facebook application)
